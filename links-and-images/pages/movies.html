        <ul>
            <li><h2> The Karate Kid</h2></li>
                <img src="../images/karate.jpg" alt="karate Kid Movie">
                    <p>The Karate Kid is a 2010 martial arts drama film directed by Harald Zwart, and part of the Karate Kid series<br>
                    This film does not take place in the same fictional universe as the four previous Karate Kid films,<br>
                    but is instead a remake of the original 1984 film with the setting moved to China,<br>
                    and the martial art changed (despite the film's title) from karate to kung fu.</p>

                    <p>This movie reminds me of my childhood. I remember watching this movie and it <br>
                    inspired me to never give up on your dream. If you work hard, you can achieve your goals. </p>
            
            <li><h2> Fast & Furious</h2></li>
                <img src="../images/f9.jpg" alt="Fast & furious movie">
                    <p>
                        Fast & Furious is hands down my absolute favorite movie! The high-octane action, heart-pounding car chases, <br>
                        and intense stunts leave me on the edge of my seat every time. Vin Diesel and the entire cast bring an unmatched <br>
                        energy and charisma to the screen, making it an exhilarating experience from start to finish. The franchise's <br>
                        blend of adrenaline-pumping moments and heartfelt camaraderie keeps me coming back for more. Fast & Furious is <br>
                        the epitome of cinematic entertainment, and I can never get enough of it! Vrooming with excitement, it reigns as <br>
                        the ultimate movie experience for me.</p>
        </ul>
